Object-oriented programming is a big seller these days.  Some managers would
rather have objects than sliced bread.

No, there is nothing glamorous about debugging. It is the ugly duckling of our
profession, the admission that we are far from perfect, the one activity that is
the least predictable or accountable -- and a constant impetus to feelings of
remorse and guilt: "if only we had done better right from the start, we wouldn't
be stuck in this mess." The defect is the crime; debugging is the punishment.

I'm not sure how the company lost sight of what matters to our customers, both
business and home, the most, but in my view we lost our way. I think our teams
lost sight of what bug-free means, what resilience means, what full scenarios
mean, what security means, what performance means, how important current
applications are, and really understanding what the most important problems our
customers face are. I see lots of random features and some great vision, but
that does not translate into great products... I would buy a Mac today if I was
not working at Microsoft.

FTP is a dinosaur left over from the time before the Internet as it is known
today, when research universities were leased lined together and FTP was used to
share files among research Scientists.

These days, CVSup is fairly easy to build on most Unix-like platforms. The
minor difficulties that still exist stem from the fact that CVSup is written in
the programming language NotC. What is NotC? Well, to most people, it really
doesn't matter. The important thing is that NotC is *not* C.

If anybody asks for advice whether to use goto or not, you should tell
them not to use it. People who ask for advice shouldn't use goto.

At some point they will not ask for advice anymore, and at some point
they will either start thinking for themselves or they will not. If they
think for themselves, they will use goto when it is appropriate and
avoid it when it is inappropriate, and if they are smart they will know
when it is appropriate. If they don't think for themselves, they will
still insist that goto is always evil.

Usual indication of "not thinking" is when you present an example that
is more readable because it uses goto, and they insist that it is worse
because it uses goto. So the conclusion that they draw is that using
"goto" is bad because you use "goto".

I still maintain the point that designing a monolithic kernel in 1991 is a
fundamental error.  Be thankful you are not my student.  You would not get a
high grade for such a design :-)

I claim that anybody that hasn't noticed by now that I'm an opinionated
bastard, and that "impolite" is my middle name, is lacking a few clues.
Finally, it's clear that I'm not only the smartest person around, I'm also
incredibly good-looking, and that my infallible charm is also second only to my
becoming modesty.
So there. Just to clarify.

I mean, if 10 years from now, when you are doing something quick and dirty, you
suddenly visualize that I am looking over your shoulders and say to yourself,
"Dijkstra would not have liked this", well that would be enough immortality for
me.

"OpenBSD did it" is no more reason to dirty up our libc with this kind of
ill-considered interface than "SCO Xenix did it". NetBSD libc should not be the
union of every mistake anyone ever made in libc in any version of Unix.

Using prototyping to learn which features you don't have to implement helps
optimization for performance; you don't have to optimize what you don't write.
The most powerful optimization tool in existence may be the delete key. One of
my most productive days was throwing away 1000 lines of code.
